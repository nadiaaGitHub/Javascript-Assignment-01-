<!-- calculate the fitrah amount, first, ask the user to enter the total number of family
members using the prompt and store the value in a variable called
"familyMembers". Next, ask the user to choose a fitrah method by providing them
options using the prompt, and store the selected method and its price in variables.
Then, use an if-else block to check the user's input and calculate the fitrah amount
by multiplying the selected method's price with the number of family members.
Finally, display the calculated fitrah amount using an alert message. -->
