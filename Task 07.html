<!-- Create a program that asks the user for their nationality, gender, and age using the prompt
function. The program should then use nested if-else statements to determine if the
person is eligible to vote.
First, the program should check if the person is Pakistani or Indian. If they are not, the
program should display a message saying they are not eligible to vote.
If they are Pakistani or Indian, the program should then check their gender. If the person is
male and over the age of 18, they are eligible to vote. If the person is female and over the
age of 18, the program should ask if they are married. If they are married, they are eligible
to vote. If they are not married, they are not eligible to vote.
If the person is under 18, the program should display a message saying they are not eligible
to vote. -->
