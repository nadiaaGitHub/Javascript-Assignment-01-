<!-- Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and stores it
in a variable called "secretNumber". Then, ask the user to enter a guess for the
secret number using a prompt.
Use an if-else statement to check if the user's guess matches the secret number. If
the guess is correct, display a message using an alert saying "Congratulations! You
guessed the secret number". Otherwise, if the guess is too high or too low, display
an appropriate message informing the user to guess again. -->

<script>
    // generates a random number
    var secretnumber = 3

    // user input
    var userinput = + prompt("Guess the number between 1 and 10 ");

    if (userinput == 3) {
        alert('Congratulations! You guessed the secret number');
    }
    else if (userinput > 3) {
        alert('Sorry its to High! Please try Again');
    }
    else if (userinput < 3) {
        alert('Sorry its to Low! Please try Again');
    }

    else {
        alert('Sorry its wrong! Please try Again');
    }
